# purescript-pipe-op

Pipe operators `(<|)` and `(|>)` for purescript

Purescript follows the convention used in haskell, where `(<|)` is the same as `($)`, and 
`(|>)` is the same as `(#)`.

This library is for those who like the pipe operator syntax more, which is used in other 
fp languages like Fsharp, Ocaml, and Elm.
